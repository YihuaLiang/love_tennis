  <p text-align="center">I began to play tennis when I was 12. In those summer holiday, I spent 4 hours on tennis everyday. </p>
  <p text-align="center">However, when I gradually grow up, I can't spend so much time on tennis anymore. <br/>
     Since I have learned skills in IT and computer science, I think I could show my love and experience in tennis in another way.</p>
  <p text-align="center">This website are intended to provide various media resources for tennis lover<br/>
    no matter whether they play tennis or not and when they start to love tennis.<br/>

    <p text-align="center">I have learned very basic html before, so this project helps me review the skills I have learned. </p>
    <p text-align="center">Furthermore, I learned more useful skills not only in technique coding but also website designments <br/>
       For example, applying proper tags for different contents is a very significant skill. Controlling white space by padding and<br/>
       margin is also quite fantastic. The examples provided in JS bin are quite helpful for me to learn what a good website looks like</p>
    <p text-align="center">Since I was the one of the leaders in my home university's tennis club, I will consider adding more contents<br/>
      relevant to tennis activities on campus. Perhaps I could hand this website to my friend who is the leader now as a template.<br/>
      Then more interactive contents will be added e.g. registration for the club membership, signing up for a tennis class, booking a court<br/>
      even a forum to talk about tennis skills. PHP, database or some 3rd party software(wordpress) could also be considered for this website.</p>
