<p text-align="center">Bjorn Borg from Sweden is a former world No.1 tennis player widely considered to be one of the greatest in the history of the sport. </p>
<p text-align="center">A player of great athleticism and endurance, he had a distinctive style and appearanceâ€”bowlegged and very fast.<br/>
   His muscularity allowed him to put heavy topspin on both his forehand and two-handed backhand. He followed Jimmy Connors in using the two-handed backhand. </p>
<p text-align="center">Borg had one of the most distinctive playing styles in the Open Era.<br/>
   He played from the baseline, with powerful ground-strokes. <br/>
   His highly unorthodox backhand involved taking his racket back with both hands but actually generating his power with his dominant right hand, <br/>
   letting go of the grip with his left hand around point of contact, and following through with his swing as a one-hander.<br/>
   He hit the ball hard and high from the back of the court and brought it down with considerable topspin, which made his ground strokes very consistent.<br/>
   There had been other players, particularly Rod Laver and Arthur Ashe, who played with topspin on both the forehand and backhand, <br/>
   yet Laver and Ashe used topspin only as a way to mix up their shots to pass their opponents at the net easily.<br/>
    Borg was one of the first top players to use heavy topspin on his shots consistently.</p>
