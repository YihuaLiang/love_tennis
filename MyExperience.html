<p>My reflection</p>
<p>I have learned very basic html before and this project helps me review the skills I have learned. </p>
<p>Furthermore, I learned more useful skills not only in coding but also website design <br/>
   For example, applying proper tags for different contents is a very significant skill. Controlling white space by padding and<br/>
   margin is also quite fantastic. The examples provided in JS bin are quite helpful for me to learn what a good website looks like</p>
<p>Since I was the one of the leaders in my home university's tennis club, I will consider adding more contents<br/>
  relevant to tennis activities on campus. Perhaps I could hand this website to my friend who is the leader now as a template.<br/>
  Then more interactive contents will be added e.g. registration for the club membership, signing up for a tennis class, booking a court<br/>
  even a forum to talk about tennis skills. PHP, database or some 3rd party software(wordpress) could also be considered for this website.</p>

  <p> Suggestion on tennis skills</p>
<p>I have been playing tennis for 8 years and learned useful tips from friends.</p>
<p>Don't stand on the court straight but with your knee a little curl.<br/>
   Begin every actions from your feet and keep your arms and hands relaxed.</p>
<p>Be concentrated on the ball.<br/>
  run fast and arrive the right position in time. Keep adjusting your body to find the best way to hit the ball</p>
